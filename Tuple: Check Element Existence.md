# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program
~~~


      tuplex = ("s", "8", "a", "v", "n", "g", "u", "r", "c", "e")
      print("n" in tuplex)
      print("8" in tuplex)
~~~
## Output
<img width="287" height="135" alt="438848455-39855931-dafa-4d80-afc7-8895211b4f24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b979a119-932a-4920-ae2b-6082a7edea0d" />

## Result
Thus,the program has been execueted successfully.
